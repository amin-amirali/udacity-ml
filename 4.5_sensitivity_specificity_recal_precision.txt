In the cancer example, sensitivity and specificity are the following:

Sensitivity: Of all the people with cancer, how many were correctly diagnosed?
Specificity: Of all the people without cancer, how many were correctly diagnosed?
And precision and recall are the following:

Recall: Of all the people who have cancer, how many did we diagnose as having cancer?
Precision: Of all the people we diagnosed with cancer, how many actually had cancer?

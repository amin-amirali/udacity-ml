    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our job is to predict if users are or not earning more than 50K, we want to focus on binary algorithms. I would look to use one of the following 3 models:\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "  - Real world application - based on a user's LinkedIn profile (using characteristics such as age, experience, gender, location, studies), decide what new job positions could be relevant to present on their frontpage; alternatively, use this info to decide which adds to present.\n",
    "  - Strengths - decision trees implicitly choose features; decision trees don't need as much data preparation; decision trees don't require any assumptions of linearity in the data; they are easy to interpret [1] http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics\n",
    "  - Weaknesses - data can easily be overfit (attention must be paid to max_depth and min_samples_leaf); tree structure prone to sampling (outliers in sample data may produce bad results in evaluation and scoring data); optimal tree is NP (imagine all the combinations possible from 13 features, plus their one-hot-enconding, as we have...) [2] https://www.edupristine.com/blog/decision-trees-development-and-scoring\n",
    "  - Good candidate? There are a good amount of features for the decision tree to explore. It makes sense that the result of earning more than 50k could be identified by making decisions based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines\n",
    "  - Real world application - detecting faces on an image and showing a boundary [3] https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/]\n",
    "  - Strengths - good when there is not much understanding of the data, with an appropriate kernel function great results can be obtained, less risk of overfitting.\n",
    "  - Weaknesses - A proper kernel must be chosen; not the best performing [4] http://www.svms.org/disadvantages.html; difficult interpretation, tough to calibrare since we cannot see the model [5] https://statinfer.com/204-6-8-svm-advantages-disadvantages-applications/\n",
    "  - Good candidate? We don't have a complete understanding of the data; kernel-trick could be a good way to separate the data, if we can find a proper kernel; its an available algoritm that we can, at the very least, experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Method AdaBoost\n",
    "  - Real world application - also useful for face recognition [6] https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/\n",
    "  - Strengths - it corrects upon its mistakes\n",
    "  - Weaknesses - outliers may provoke overfitting [7] https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-the-various-Tree-Ensemble-classification-algorithms\n",
    "  - Good candidate? Its one of the examples that we explored; we can use it with a DecisionTreeClassifier, which is easy to understand; plenty of columns means that plenty of weak learners could be spawned, and some of them are expected to produce good results; in this way, we should be able to \"cut\" the data nicely.\n"

Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "~~Looking at prediction times, we see that the SVC model clearly performs the worse from all of the models - it takes a lot of time for both training the model as for predicting results.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Performance of both DecisionTree and AdaBoost seem to be very similar, but we can see from the results of the training set that the DecisionTree seems to take a bit longer (though the chart is hidding the details, since the SVC is skewing the results).\n",
    "What sets them appart is both the accuracy and, most importantly, the F-score.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~In the search of finding the best model that predicts our outcome the best, we chose to use the F$_{0.5}$ score as a measure of accuracy since it values precision over recall - meaning that it is more important to correctly identify people earning more than 50k than it is to penalize false positives (as asking for a donation from someone earning less than 50k is not a big problem).~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~Analyzing the F-score results on the testing data, we see that the AdaBoost Classifier shows the best results, for any set size.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~I am, then, compeled to proceed work using the AdaBoost model.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the training charts, we see that all models train all sets of data within a similar time period, except for SVC with all of the data, it is quite a spike!\n",
    "Both DecisionTree (DT) and AdaBooster (AB) perform very well and quite alike, decreasing just slightly in both accuracy and  F$_{0.5}$ with the more data used. They are both potential candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the test data, we see that SVC is still not performing good - it is the one that takes the longest to predict. However, the accuracy and F$_{0.5}$ scores are the best from all 3 models. It looks like the weaknesses of DT and AB are showing - they are overfitting the data (train results are great, test results are not). This is but a slight overfit, though, since the results are not that much different from what the SVC accomplishes. AB is actually doing a very good job if we take into consideration how much time it takes to run the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's interesting to see how poorly SVC does on 1% of the test data, and how quickly that changes when using just 10% of the data, but not an important result for our conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though AB is not F$_{0.5}$-scoring as great as SVC, I would recommend using it since it has very good results and it runs fast. Ultimately, if time is a major concern, I would recommend using DT - it is good in accuracy and runs super fast.\n",
    "SVC takes a long time, so for a 1-off scenario where data does not need to be retained and there is no pressure in obtaining immediate predictions, it could be used. But there is a high price on its accuracy - either time or cost (of having to run the model in bigger and more expensive machines).\n",

    " - Trains a weak classifier using a classification algorithm (we used the Decision Tree Classifier), and finds where it failed predicting.\n",
    " - Penalises these bad predictions by assigning them high weights\n",
    " - Calculates the weight of this weak learner (50% accuracy is equivalent to weight zero; lower accuracies are negative weight) and proceeds to the next iteration\n",

    "\n",
    "At the end of all iterations, AdaBoost combines (ensembles) all weak learners by using their calculated weights. Interestingly, is will not be uncommon for it to use the results from weak learners with very negative weights - it will apply the exact opposite of what they predict! By ensambling the results from different weak learners, it improves the results of using models individually - it learns at each iteration and further improves the results."

Also, people with families will logically want to put more attention to their earnings, though I would consider if they might not be the best targets for our campaign.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
